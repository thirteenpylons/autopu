## autopu
	autopu is created for my wife as a temporary solution and alternative to 
	setting up USPS pickups for sales on Etsy. This is really just a personal
	project, but if anyone could benefit from using it, farout.
	I'm also aware that this is not a 'conventional' approach.

## Goal
	* Everyday @1am create browser instance(etsy.com)
	* Check for sales at datetime
	* If sales > 0: GOTO->usps.com { setup pickup }
	

## Code Contribution Guidelines
    * Fork away and refactor | add code. I encourage pull requests to allow for 
    review and discussion of code changes.
    * When creating a pull request:
        * Have test cases for the new code.
        * Add documentation if you are adding new features or changing functionality.
        * Converge commits. `git rebase -i`.
